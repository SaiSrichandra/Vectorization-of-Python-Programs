"""
Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Note:
A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

    # 1. Very normal inorder traversal
    # 2. Notice line 32,33. Always update wrongs[1], but wrongs[0] will only update one time
    #    Reason is image [1,2,3,4,5,6], swap to [1,2,6,4,5,3]
    #    We will find out 6 > 4 and 5 > 3
    #    So first time we should update wrongs[0] = last,
    #       second time we should update wrongs[1] = root
    #    But line 34 first time we also update wrong[1] because if we have [1,2,4,3,5,6]
    #    4 is next to 3 so we need to update them at the same time
