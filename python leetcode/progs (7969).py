Leetcode: Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
For example: Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [1,3,2].
Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

Leetcode: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. 
(ie, from left to right, level by level).
For example: Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its level order traversal as:

Leetcode: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II
Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. 
(ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).
For example: Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
    3

LeetCode: Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
For example: Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
    3

  9  20
