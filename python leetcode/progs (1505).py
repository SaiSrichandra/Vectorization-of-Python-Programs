Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character

    # 1. This dp is a bit diff, the length of dp is A+1, B+1
    # 2. Others are the same, remember how to initiate the dp matrix
    # 3. When comparing the i, it compares with word[i-1] and word[j-1]
