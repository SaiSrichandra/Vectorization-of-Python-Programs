# Python3 simple approach to print smallest
# and second smallest element.

# driver code

arr = [111, 13, 25, 9, 34, 1]
n = len(arr)
# sorting the array using
# in-built sort function
arr.sort()

# printing the desired element
print("smallest element is "+str(arr[0]))
print("second smallest element is "+str(arr[1]))
